				<p style="text-align: center;">"Hyperautomation deals with the application of advanced technologies including AI and machine learning to increasingly automate processes and augment humans.”</p>

As no single tool can replace humans, hyperautomation involves using multiple tools in symphony, including robotic process automation (RPA), intelligent business management software (iBPMS) and AI, with the goal of increasingly AI-driven decision making. It’s the next step beyond RPA, further replacing human involvement in physical and digital tasks, and eventually the complete decision-making process.
